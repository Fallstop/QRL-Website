# Ages 9+, Thursday 3:15 to 5:00pm.

#### [Sign Up Form][sul]

The Technohackers Coding and Robotics Group is all about getting into coding and dreaming about the cool game they are going to create or the robot you want to
build. You can start in this group without knowing what you are doing and work towards your own creations (not knowing what your doing is where we all start). This
group is about learning coding to make games and then some of us might get distracted into making and programming Robots. Because why not.

Contact Kevin for more information. Participants will need access to laptop, perseverance and a love of computer games. We have a couple spare laptops and are
always looking for not-too-old donations. The group is supported by our older Questionable Research Lab members (Technohackers members who are older and are now
our team of experts).

If you would like to join in [here is the term 1 sign-up form][sul].

# Other useful information:

- You do need your own laptop (or lug in a PC). We have a couple spare to use but not enough for all. Your own laptop is best.
- We are using the Whangarei Club in Rust Ave. This is across the road from the old Library. There is parking for dropping off to the left of the building.
- The name “Technohackers” was created by the members. “Techno” is short for technology while “hackers” is shorthand for those of us that create, make, and generally modify technology to solve problems. There is no negative connotation to the word in our context.
- We are supported by a voluntary but important membership ($10/week), more information on membership can be found [here](/info/membership).
