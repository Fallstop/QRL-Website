This group is for the geek in us all. We explore a somewhat random range of topics from a science/tech/geeky perspective. Each week is different and each term has
a different theme. As with all our Technohackers groups, we intend it to be a fun clever environment where disaster has plenty of opportunity. Most sessions
involve a talk followed by an experiment, a challenge or a demonstration. No one knows how stuff will go – we try things out and see what happens. In fact
everything we do is an experiment. If you are not a member at the moment [Sign Up here][sul]. If you are a member and are going to come to this group, could you
put your name on [this list here][sulmo].

This term we are going to mess with Chemistry. It will be a chance to explode, melt and burn as we look at Carbon, Oxygen and Hydrogen (mainly, never trust our
plans, we might get distracted and do other things as well, who knows?).

Last Year: In term 1 we also looked at chemistry, mainly in connection to food (but not always). A lot of sugar was caramelized and crystallized. Then in term 2 we
looked at ART with our science brains switched on. In term 3, we got into FORENSICS and it was all fingerprints, footprints, blood splatters, fire, exploding
airbags and rotting bodies. In term 4 we finished the year with a geeky look at CIRCUS performance with the help of Circus Kumarani. In years prior to this we have
looked at the brain, projectiles and rockets and construction among other topics.

- The current term will be running Tuesdays from 3:15 to 5:00pm at the Whangarei Club. This is for 9 years and up.
  It is ok to arrive later and leave earlier than this if needed, but we will formally kick off at around 3:55 and formally end at around 5:15.
- The 2020 sign-up form can be found at [this link here][sul]
- We are normally still winding down/packing up till 5:30 so if someone’s pickup is going to be later than this for some reason, give us a call or text to let us
  know.
- Please always sign-in when arriving.
- Kevin coordinates and runs the sessions with the help of others. Contact him for information and with questions. He also has one child attending the group (Jasper
  aged 15).

# Other useful information:

- We do not provide afternoon snacks other than water and fruit. For some, the experience of dying of malnutrition will be an issue and providing an extra bit of
  food from home could be a good thing.
- We are using the Whangarei Club in Rust Ave. This is across the road from the old Library. There is parking for dropping off to the left of the building.
- The name “Technohackers” was created and picked by the kids. “Techno” is short for technology while “hackers” is shorthand for those of us that create, make, and
  generally modify technology to solve problems. There is no negative connotation to the word in our context.
- Technohackers are the educational groups within the Questionable Research Labs
- If a young person is not collected and we are unable to contact their family by 6:30pm, the police will be notified. It’s never happened but this is just so you
  know the process.
- We encourage parents with skills or interest to help out and we also focus on peer tutoring and support.
- We are supported by $10/week BUT if that is not not affordable, come anyway and just let us know. Do not let money be a barrier, that’s not why we are there. More
  information can be found on the Membership page.
- For further information please email Kevin@Technohackers.org
- We are always on the lookout for sponsorship.
