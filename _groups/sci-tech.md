This group is for the geek in us all. We explore a somewhat random range of topics from a science/tech/geeky perspective. Each week is different and each term has
a different theme. As with all our Technohackers groups, we intend it to be a fun clever environment where disaster has plenty of opportunity. Most sessions
involve a talk followed by an experiment, a challenge or a demonstration. No one knows how stuff will go – we try things out and see what happens. In fact
everything we do is an experiment.

# This term

This term we are going to mess with Electricity. It will probably be a bit shocking and I am sure there will be sparks and smoke. Intentional and not. But we might get distracted and do other things as well, who knows?

# Other useful information:

- We do not provide afternoon snacks other than water and fruit. For some, the experience of dying of malnutrition will be an issue and providing an extra bit of
  food from home could be a good thing.
- Technohackers are the educational groups within the Questionable Research Labs
- If a young person is not collected and we are unable to contact their family by 6:30pm, the police will be notified. It’s never happened but this is just so you
  know the process.
- We encourage parents with skills or interest to help out and we also focus on peer tutoring and support.
- We are supported by $10/week [membership](/info/membership) BUT if that is not not affordable, come anyway and just let us know. Do not let money be a barrier, that’s not why we are there. More
  information can be found on the Membership page.
- For further information please email kevin@questionable.org.nz
- We are always on the lookout for sponsorship.
