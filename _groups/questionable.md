This group is for Teens who are interested in playing with ideas and maybe turning some of them into reality. This might be game development, playing with
hardware, robotics, web development and other random science and technology related activities.
Running: Thursdays 6pm to 8pm from the Whangarei Club (Rust Ave).

For some the goal is to learn how to make games and code in a relaxed environment with others doing the same thing. For others it is about working together on
questionable projects (current examples include, modifying a vending machine to be vend the unexpected; learning Unity; hacked VR headsetdeveloping a water tank
sensing/reporting device; adding muscle stimulation to a VR game; building a cloud chamber to visualise ionising radiation; setting up a gameserver etc). We help
each other and generally just have fun as we ramp up our skills and play with ideas. Sometimes this is all disaster and confusion, but sometimes itâ€™s brilliant.
Both are important.

Kevin coordinates and runs the sessions. We get a pile of pizza or burgers for a shared dinner (plus drinks and fruit) so bring $5-$8.50+. If you would like to join us [**here** is the sign-up form][sul].

# Other useful information:

You do need your own laptop (or lug in a PC).
We are using the Whangarei Club in Rust Ave. This is across the road from the old Library. There is parking for dropping off to the left of the building.
We are supported by membership ($10/week). If not affordable there is sponsorship available. See our [membership page](/info/membership) for membership details.
