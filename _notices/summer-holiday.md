## **Here is what we have going on:**


### December 2021:

**TUESDAY, 21st** (Ages 8+):

 > Take Things Apart & Make DIY Christmas decorations.

Create your own Christmas decorations out of electronic waste that we're taking apart. Fancy a laser-shooting dinosaur on your Christmas tree? Or a half-reindeer-half-unicorn or robot-Santa made out of wires and old circuit boards? We're taking apart our electronic waste to create our own Christmas decorations. You can bring your own things to pull apart or dig into ours.


**WEDNESDAY, 22nd** (Ages 13+): Not Serious day. 

> Bring your computer for a social play time with maybe some accidental seriousness.

These days are just for fun. It is for hanging out with friends, playing games, playing more games and then well… probably blowing up a Minecraft world or something.

Being in the Labs on the Serious Days is for making, creating, coding, working on projects, it doesn’t matter what, with friends and a bit of game playing on the side. A brain expanding day of questionable project time. Know your plan before you arrive. It can even be school work/study. On Serious Days we will keep on going into the evening (as with our normal Thursday Questionable Project group) so if you are staying late bring cash ($8) for our shared dinner.

**FRIDAY 14th**: Non-digital Game Day.

> Board games, card games, D&D, NERF fights and more.

A day full of everything you’ve always wanted to play: Dungeons & Dragons, board games, card games, weird theatreform games, timed NERF fights, live action role plays… and more! Bring your own games, if you want to (not necessary).
