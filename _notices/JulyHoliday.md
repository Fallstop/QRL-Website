## The Day of The Thread - Tues 12th & Wed 13th July

<p align="center"> Join us for Two Days of Making and Creating <br>with the <b>University of Auckland</b> and <b>Questionable Research Labs</b></p>

In the Science and Design Lab we will be doing a deep dive into all things stringy and thready. From rope, knots and catapults to crochet, knitting and weaving. Candyfloss and noodles will add to the chaos.  We will <b>Learn</b>, <b>Make</b> and most definitely <b>Experiment</b>.<br><br>  
<b>Day 1</b> will be an introduction to each of the skills we be playing with. Itâ€™s about trying things out, learning new skills and at any opportunity geeking out about the science behind it all.<br><br> 
<b>Day 2</b> is a making day. Let's use our new skills to Create Something New. Who knows what that will be? Experimentation encouraged. It could be a disaster! Or it could be crazy cool. Both outcomes will definitely happen.  

<br> 
Bring happiness and your give it a go attitude.<br>This event is for youth and teens with appreciation of disaster, success and weirdness.<br>  
Starting at 8:30 and ending at 5pm each day<br>

Lunch will be provided and there will be plenty of fruit and water for snacking.
