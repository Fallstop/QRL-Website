 We are changing this group this term - it is a time where you can work on projects or be learning Blender or Unity or Roblox game development or any other thing. It is serious time for those that need more time in the Lab to get stuff done. Even homework. It is not serious till 4pm then we will be most definitily in serious mode. Whatever that is for you<br>

 - **Wednesday: Quest Speakers and also Adult Events**<br>
   Will be using this time for a diversity of Guest Speakers as we are able to capture them.<br>
   And secondly, later in the term we plan to start having events for people who have more practice being alive than our usual pretenders.<br>
   Speakers and events will be announced via the mailing list as they are organised.<br>
  <br><br>


 - **Thursday:  Media Lab**  On Hold for the moment<br>
   We are going to have a think about how we use this time so the group is on hold for just a few weeks. Perhaps (open to peoples thoughts) it would be a time for those who want to make films (last 2 terms were more about experimenting with techniques). Maybe its time to do some Vidos for YouTube etc  Shorts or Tutorials or Promotional or? We need to have a bit of a think<br>
   <br>
   Till we kick this off, you might want to put ideas into this form [Media Lab Ideas](https://forms.gle/mRLrZjagBw7ZmiUJ8)<br>
