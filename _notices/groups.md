  THIS TERM hmmm... I am not sure yet what theme we will pick this term? <br>
  It might be time to look at engineering again? Or Magic or Music or Computer Science or Film and Photography or Rockets orâ€¦ Whatever topic we look at we do it with our  brains turned on. There is science in everything when we look just under the surface.<br>
  While we will have a main topic we will also weave in other random things that are interesting. Because why not.<br>
