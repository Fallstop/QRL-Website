This is a big national event and our team(s) will need a real diversity of skills as well as people who have no idea what they are doing. We will be doing a script, sound, lighting, editing, filming, acting as well as needing help with 2,143 smaller tasks). Let's do this. Itâ€™s 48hrs in the lab getting a short film nailed.
