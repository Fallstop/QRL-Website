All days open at 8:30am and finish at 5:00pm (5:30 late pickup), except for the short film making weekend. We provide plenty of fruit and water. Lunch is always included. There is a cost for the days, but if it is a problem, sponsored spots are available, just ask. Costs vary slightly (see below). Please assume that you have a spot on our program and that we can accommodate you if you haven't heard from us within two days of signing up. The invoices for direct deposit will be emailed to you sometime around the holidays. If you have questions, email kevin@questionable.org.nz or verena@questionable.org.nz

**NOT SERIOUS DAYS (Ages 8+)**  Tuesday the 5th and 12th October: These days are just for fun. It is for hanging out with friends, playing games, playing more games and then well… probably blowing up a Minecraft world or something. **Cost is $45 and for members is $30**

**SERIOUS DAYS (Ages 13+)**  Wednesday the 6th and 13th October: Being in the Labs on the Serious Days is for making, creating, coding, working on projects, it doesn’t matter what, with friends and a bit of game playing on the side. A brain expanding day of questionable project time. Know your plan before you arrive. It can even be school work/study. On Serious Days we will keep on going into the evening (as with our normal Thursday Questionable Project group) so if you are staying late bring cash ($8) for our shared dinner. **Cost is $45 and for members is $30**
