Being in the Labs on the serious days, is for making, creating, coding, working on projects, it doesn't matter what, with friends and a bit of game playing on the side. A brain expanding day of seriously questionable stuff.

## Non-Serious days

These days are just for fun. It is for hanging out with friends, playing games, playing more games and then well... probably blowing up a minecraft world or something.

This is an all day Minecraft adventure to save the world of Argolia.
If you play minecraft this is THE day for you. SAVE THE WORLD!

- **Saturday 16th January**

Saturday 16th: Make a CHEESE, Brew a BEER, Distill a GIN

We are doing something for us less-young people. This is meant to be a relaxed, social get-together. And maybe learning something, as we brew a beer, distill a gin and make some cheese. This will be in a barn about 40 minutes out of Whangarei. If you are interested here is a bit more information.

# Camping in the Labs

- **Saturday 23rd January**

# Additional Days

## Older Member

The labs will be open on weekdays to the older members (14+) for casual use when we donâ€™t have a formal event/activity. I will be providing a calendar later that will be more specific. On some days they will be open late.

## Younger Members

Younger members (under 14) who would like to spend a day in the labs during the holidays can do this if we have notice so we can match them up with an older member for babysitting (up to 2 younger members per older member). The parent/guardian is expected to provide an appropriate allowance directly to the minder. I think this is a good way for our teens to earn a bit of cash and for parents who need a break/have something on, to do so. I (Kevin) will be in the building or another adult will be around if needed.
