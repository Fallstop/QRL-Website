## **20 June 2021**


Term 2 Week 8 Email

Hello all,
There is Important information below. But who knows where it is? That’s right, you need to read it all. This is the sort of cruel and inhuman punishment schools use with students every day and obviously they must do it for a good reason.
So in a discombobulating order we have:

1/ **The word of the day** is “discombobulated”. Arise, you vastly underutilized beautiful word.


1/ **THANKS** to those who provided plants for the lab. Most notably Sarah Reed who’s decorated pots you will admire. Maybe the 5 less decorative pots could get similar inspiration if someone young or older is keen. Probably starting with the containers.


1/ **THANKS** to those who have brought in Jars and plastic containers. I think we now have a good stock. Job done.


1/ **THANKS** to those who have helped with our reorganisation day. From the storage room having labeled box’s to the Bean Bags getting patches and reinforced seams. It made a significant difference. For Sheldon, Verena, Mac and I working with our youthful primates has been simplified. Nice.


1/ **SCIENCE GROUP**: Bring in a sample of your Kombucha if it survived. And even if it didn't it might still have a story to tell. If your sourdough starter is still alive and not sentient, I dare you to make bread and bring a bit in. I will have another go with my one as well. On Tuesday, Tim from [Whangarei Gourmet Mushrooms](https://www.mushroomgourmet.co.nz/) will be here for a chat.  
HELP: If someone has the time on Monday/Tuesday to get our Fungi photos printed out let me know. We will put them up on the wall. I can share a folder with the photos.


1/ **T-Shirts**:  Still not done - so the list is still open, [put your name on this list](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1y9H_YkerXTbWqJQPqXhJXSzIAgzKvRDx?usp=sharing).


1/ **HELP**: Please please, check the lost property for things that might have been left behind or [check out the pictures here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1y9H_YkerXTbWqJQPqXhJXSzIAgzKvRDx?usp=sharing). Jackets, sweatshirts, drink bottles, a 2 Rupee coin, a ring. If it is not grafted to their skin it is probably in our heap. It is growing exponentially and we have calculated the mass of lost property will exceed the mass of the earth 2.4 years. Exponential growth is a killer! 


1/ **HOLIDAYS**: The first week of the Holidays will be busy in the lab. The second week is a bit quieter. Teens/adults with projects to work on can use the labs on the quiet days as well. Here is what we have. [Read the details on the website](https://questionable.org.nz/notices/holiday-program/) and use [this sign-up form](https://forms.gle/ezSTyrJ6b6nkGASg9):

1/ **FUNDING**: If you are not a patron [(see this page)](https://questionable.org.nz/info/membership/) and can manage it, give it a go. It is how our community is able to exist.


1/ **TERRIBLE IDEA HACKATHON**: 2-4th July. This is the weekend after next. This cool creative event is at Auckland Uni (Unleash Space). We will head down on Friday for the kick-off in the evening, then we will stay down there till we flee back home on Sunday afternoon. You need to put your name on 2 lists: [Our list here](https://forms.gle/gMeVdidvgZxkGh327) and then also the actual [event sign-up here](https://terriblehack.nz/). Parents coming down and teens both need to do both those sign-ups. Costs will be around $60ish for shared transport and food. Sleeping bag plus stretcher or mat is needed as well as survival equipment like phone charger etc You know the story.


1/ **HELP**: If you think it is a good idea for us to do X, and you have 30 seconds in your life that is free, volunteer to help make it happen. That is a good way to contribute.


1/ **KIWIJAM**: July 23-25th. Also at Auckland Uni, so another weekend away for teens. 48hr Game Development competition. Put this date onto a calendar of some sort and put your name on [our sign-up form here](https://forms.gle/88qgNRMDfeXmMX1X7). Also please do the [official sign up here](https://kiwijam.org/). 


1/ **SOCIAL MEDIA**: [https://www.facebook.com/questionablerresearchlabs](https://www.facebook.com/questionablerresearchlabs)
	**HELP**: Social media wizards are needed to help with this. Maybe also Instagram and Twitter etc accounts would be good if there is someone able to do that? Talk to Verena if interested: [verena@questionable.org.nz](mailto:verena@questionable.org.nz) or 0276073711



**Message from Kim**<br />
**HOUSEKEEPING** – Many hands make light work!  
At the end of the session the kids do a pretty decent job at tidying up the majority of the space but there are areas which are left to the facilitators.  I would like to ask that the caregivers who collect their children at the end of the sessions, pitch in every so often to help with these ten minute chores. The first area I am looking at is the toilets. I will be posting a sign-off sheet and cleaning guide in the bathroom. If you have a few minutes to spare, please check to see if it has already been signed off for the day, and if it hasn’t, your help would be very much appreciated!
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to speak to the facilitators at the Lab or send me an email at [kim@questionable.org.nz](mailto:kim@questionable.org.nz).




That's it you have reached the end of the email and your life can begin again. Well done.

Cheers from
Kevin, Verena, Sheldon Mac and Kim (and ALL the other hidden contributors to our community)
