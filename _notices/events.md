## COME AND GONE RECENTLY


- **Bush Walk** - Sunday 18th of June<br>
Add your name to this form if you are interested in joining us for a bush walk where the goal is learning about our native bush and seeing what we can discover. We won't be going far but it will be slow as there is a lot to talk about. Through the bush near wetlands, along a stream up and for the more adventurous, up a valley to a ridge and then to a big view up the coast. Back down through farmland to the barn where we started. Afternoon tea at the top or back at the barn. If time we will head to a close beach for more looking and talking<br>

- **SpaceBase Visit**  May 25th (Thursday 5:30pm) <br>
This will be a talk about NZ’s Space Industry (the sort of jobs you could get into) as well as climate change. 
Importantly they will be talking to us about the *Space for Planet Earth Challenge 2023*
[This challenge](https://spacebase.co/challenges/space-challenge-2023/) is about using satellite data, in combination with other data sources to identify locations of methane emissions on Earth. There is a category in this challenge for high school aged teams (along with University teams and professional teams).

- **Armageddon Expo** - 3/4/5 of June<br>
Lets again go down to this event as a swarm. Armageddon is a weird and interesting cultural experience. It is also an opportunity to dress up in cosplay. It is a long weekend and we will probably go down on Sunday - but plans are still to be made. We can either hire a bus (worked well last time) or as a collection of parents with cars.<br>
<br><br>

- **Fire Frenzy Night** - Friday 9th June 5:30-8pm<br>
Instead of running our Friday night group at the Labs, we will be visiting Fire Frenzy, a fire arts performance group, and everyone is invited to have a go (or simply watch, that is okay too). Younger Coding & Game Making Group: If you aren't planning to join us for Fire Frenzy, please make sure pick up happens by 5.30pm or earlier.  We will meet at the Labs in Tikipunga and share transport to the BMX track in Whangarei - or you can join us directly at the [Whangarei BMX Track:](https://goo.gl/maps/xmqNQhS9SeAyGhcU6). Everyone is welcome to join us. All ages & abilities. Free to come and watch.<br>
If you want to try fire spinning, bring $5 in cash. Please wear cotton or wool clothing!<br>
<br><br>
