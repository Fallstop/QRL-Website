- **SpaceBase Visit**  May 25th (Thursday 5:30pm) <br>
This will be a talk about NZ’s Space Industry as well as climate change. 
Importantly they will be talking to us about the *Space for Planet Earth Challenge 2023*
[This challenge](https://spacebase.co/challenges/space-challenge-2023/) is about using satellite data, in combination with other data sources to identify locations of methane emissions on Earth. There is a category in this challenge for high school aged teams (along with University teams and professional teams).

This Northland High School TWO DAY team challenge in the first week of the holidays. It's about creativity, inventiveness, silliness and cleverness.  And excessive use of duct tape and hot glue. Start dreaming up great terrible ideas now. More info to come.<br><br>

- **KiwiJam** - 21-23 July <br>
A 48hr game making event. This for physical as well as digital games. There will likely be a Whangarei site this year so we will be able to have younger people involved. Fast and frenzied game making - it is amazing what can be achieved by teams in a weekend.<br>
