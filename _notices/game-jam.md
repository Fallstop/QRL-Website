# Taitokerau Northern GAME MAKER Jam

## [Sign up form](https://takaro21.lilregie.com/booking/attendees/new)

### **19-21 February**

Do you like games and do you want to try making your own? Or would like to join  with others to help develop someone else's idea?  Everything is more fun in a team. Oh… and you will have just 48 hours to finish. This is how you stop interesting ideas lurking in the cupboard as unfinished projects. 48hrs and BAM you're done. And tired. And caffined. And happy. And Smiling.
It doesn’t matter if it's a board & card game, a tabletop game, a video game, a larp or something else. Join us for an awesome, creative weekend!
