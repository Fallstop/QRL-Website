About the **Not Serious Days (Ages 8+)** on Tuesday the 12th and 20th July:
These days are just for fun. It is for hanging out with friends, playing games, playing more games and then well... probably blowing up a Minecraft world or something.   
Cost is $45 and for members is $30

About the **Serious Days (Ages 13+)** on Wednesday the 13th and 21st July:
Being in the Labs on the Serious Days is for making, creating, coding, working on projects, it doesn't matter what, with friends and a bit of game playing on the side. A brain expanding day of questionable project time. Know your plan before you arrive. On Serious Days we will keep on going into the evening (as with our normal Thursday Questionable Project group) so if you are staying late bring cash ($8) for our shared dinner.  
Cost is $45 and for members is $30 

About the **Non-Digital Game Day (Ages 9+)** on Monday 12th July:
A day full of everything you've always wanted to play: Dungeons & Dragons, board games, card games, weird theatreform games, NERF fights, live action role plays... and more!
Bring your own games, if you want to (not necessary).
Cost is $30 for everyone

About the **Fix/Break/Recycle Day (Ages 9+)** on Friday 16th July:
Bring in your random electronic junk that would be good to disassemble and recycled, or perhaps even fixed? or maybe mutated into something else. This is a pull apart, look inside, hands-on day. Parents and adult whānau are most welcome.
Bring your own electronic junk if you have some (we have some as well)
Cost for kids/youth $30 and for supporting parents/adult whānau $10
