description: An application to help automate sending out large numbers of text messages
type: project
---

The Big Send is an application designed to help event, sports teams and other organizers send out a large number of text messages with out having to create google
contacts groups or fight with other system on the phone.

It was designed to do this securely and cheaply, using a .csv file for the list of numbers and having a simple message field. The app would then send out a text
message to each number in that list with the message specified.

Originally started in android, I have since began migrating the project to flutter to allow for ease of crossplatform porting.

I am also working on adding some merge functionality and Google Sheets functionality.

The source code is available on [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/laspruca/thebigsend)
