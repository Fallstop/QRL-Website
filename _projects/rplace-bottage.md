This year, on April Fools, reddit unleased r/place 2 eletric boogaloo. This presented an oppertunity for us at QRL to step in and have a crack at printing our mark
on the canvas

# What is r/place
For those of you have no clue what a r/place or even a reddit is, let me fill in the details. [Reddit](https://reddit.com) is a social networking site, and much like
all other social networkings sites, is a complete cesspool. r/place was a *social experiment* devised by the Reddit, in which each user on the platform could place a single
tile every five minutes, on a canvas. This whole fandangled excrement took place on April fools 2017, and then, for some unknown reason, Reddit decided to reserect this
mess of an experement in 2022, but on a larger scale. In this madness, we saw an opportunity for *botting*.

# The idea
Our project had three main parts, an loader/processor for loading and scaling images, a pallete matcher to align colors in a image to the possiable tile colors in reddit's
r/place, and finally a web scrapper that used solenium. The language that we decided to use to construct our _incredible_ code was, of cause, rust, the _best_ systems programming
language to grace the open source community. This is a bit of a favourite language for Jasper and I, so yeah... we aren't biased at all. shut.
