 - There is a big open space.

 - There are 4 offices/quiet workspaces. These will also be good for adults needing a CBD desk or meeting space.

 - There is a kitchen (lacking kitchen things).

 - A bit of a nook which we will have as a soft space (bean bags, cushions etc)

 - There is a large meeting/teaching room or perhaps a filming room after we put up a green screen.

 - There is parking out the back for easy in and out (as well as from Rathbone St)

 - There is a storage room.

 - And we will have this space for till later this year when it is redeveloped.
