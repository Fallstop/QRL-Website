## April Holiday's ##

<p align="center"><b>Not Serious Day</b></p>
Wednesday 17th - 8:30am to 5pm<br>
This is a social day. Hang out and play games with friends. The lab is a our creative playground. Serious things might happen but that will be accidental. Lunch provided. Plenty of fruit and water available. <br><br>

<p align="center"><b>Serious Day</b></p>
Friday 19th - 8:30am to 5pm<br> 
This day is for any of our experienced members who are working on projects or tutorials or generally able to do their own thing whatever that is, in our social environment. Film work, electronics, coding, general making or designing or even school work. It doesn't really matter what you want to do, but independently doing your thing (with friends) is what the serious days are about.<br><br>

<p align="center"><b>MINECRAFT GAME DAY</b></p>
Wednesday 24th - 8:30am to 5pm<br> 
I think the name says it all - this day will be a full on Minecraft game day. This day will be run by our teens Noah and Tainui (plus helpers) with Kevin as the fireman. It will be an epic supersaturated day that will leave the participants dreaming of blocks and building and mobs and diamonds and...<br>
Warning: Limited places.  <br><br>
