She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!

I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. __I need your help, Luke.__ *She needs your help.* I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.

## Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.

You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!

1. Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.
2. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.
3. I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan--

### Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.

Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly… You mean it controls your actions? I call it luck. What?! But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight?

* Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.
* You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home!
* You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away!

No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly… The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.

Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.

All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? He is here. I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? I care. So, what do you think of her, Han?

Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide.

I'm trying not to, kid. I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. You mean it controls your actions?

Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.

I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.

I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.

In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this?

As you wish. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. I call it luck. Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this?
