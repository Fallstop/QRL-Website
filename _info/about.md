Questionable Research Labs PLAY with all things related to Science, Design and Engineering.

Our Goal: To provide a purposeful environment to expand and challenge the world of curious people. A space for the geek, creator and idea breaker in us all.

At Questionable Research Labs we:

1. Love to play with ideas and try things out.
2. Are ok with not knowing what we are doing.
3. Leave plenty of room for disaster.
4. Donâ€™t focus on learning, it just happens when we play.

<br>

We see technology as the **intersection** of Science, Design and Engineering. Questionable Research Labs is this broad fun space. We indiscriminately love it all.
