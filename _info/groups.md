We are currently running the following groups. If you wish to join a group or help form a new group focusing on your own area of interest, please get in touch with
Kevin via our contact page. If you are looking for the group sign up page [here is a link][IntrestForm].

# Girls Lab Group

## Monday 3:15 to 5pm.
We will be looking into all sorts of scientific experiments, from making slime to building bridges and experimenting with electricity. This group is primarily for those up to 12yrs old but if you are older and think that sounds like fun, you are most welcome to join us as well. 

Facilitated by Verena Pschorn.

1. Because this is a new group - let people know about it. Spread the word.

# Girls Lab Group (Older group)

## Monday 5pm to 6:30pm, Teens.
For those 13+.  Unlike the earlier group, we will get more into coding, game design and web design. You can also bring your own techie projects. We are totally fine with you coming in anytime after school (while the younger group is running) to hangout and use the computers for your projects.

# Science and Technology Group

## Tuesday 3:15 to 5pm(ish), Ages 9+.

<img src="/info-page-assets/groups/experment_o.png" style="float: right">

This group is all about looking at the world with our sciencey brains turned on. We dig into anything that seems interesting and attempt experiments or challenges. Things sometimes go as we expect and sometimes not (but we like that too). Every term it is a different topic. This year we have looked at Fungi, Electricity and Disasters, this term we are going to be looking at The Design of Everyday Things. From engineering to psychology. We will pull apart, make and investigate. Facilitated by Kevin Waugh.

# Robotics Group

## Wednesday 3:15 to 5:00pm.

This is a new group this term. Participants are expected to have some basic python coding skills - just check with us if you are unsure. As with everything we do, it is mostly "learn as you go" but Python will be the main language so it is good to have a head start. We will be working on and racing some crazy autonomous mobile AI robots. There is a waiting list for this group sorry (put your name down and we will get back to you). Facilitated by Sheldon White and Kevin Waugh 

Important:

1. You need a laptop (or PC) or have talked to us about using one of our spares.

# Technohackers Coding Group

## Thursday 3:15 to 5:00pm, Ages 9+.

Before you can create your own AI overlord, make a billion dollars with your game, or construct your mind-controlled VR game, you need to play with code. This group is for doing just that with friends. Our older members help out and we also teach each other.
Facilitated by Kevin Waugh and the senior QRL members.

Important:

1. You need a laptop (or PC) or have talked to us about using one of our scarce spares. Chrome books and tablets are not ideal but might be ok at the beginning.

# Questionable Projects Group

## Thursday 5:30pm to 8:30pm, Teens.

This is teens only (13+) and it is our time for ANY project. Any. It could be coding, making, designing, whatever. Really. If you are into something, be into it with others. This is a social, clever, weird, play time. We have a shared unhealthy dinner, so bring $8 to join in on that. Now we have a kitchen we might have a go at cooking at some point. I am open to ideas.
Facilitated by Sheldon White and Kevin Waugh
