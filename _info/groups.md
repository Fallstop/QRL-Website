# Geek Girls Group

## Monday 3:15 to 5pm(ish)	 
To all girls out there, this is a new group at QRL. It's meant to be an exploration space for anything geekie and tech! We might look into game development, graphic design, music making, video making, coding or even wildly creative mechanical projects. It can range from simple to very complex, and we'll figure it out on the way. The weirder, the better - as long as fun is a thing!

Facilitated by Verena Pschorn.

Important:
1. This group starts again in the first week of term 2 (Monday 3rd)
2. Because this is a new group - let people know about it. Spread the word.
3. [Say your coming here][IntrestForm]

# Science and Technology Group

## Ages 9+, Tuesday 3:15 to 5pm(ish).

<img src="/info-page-assets/groups/experment_o.png" style="float: right">

This group is all about looking at the world with our sciencey brains turned on. We dig into anything that seems interesting and attempt experiments or challenges. Things sometimes go as we expect and sometimes not (but we like that too). Every term it is a different topic. Last term it was Electricity and it was a bit shocking, this term is going to be both disgusting and tasty as we look at Fungi (Biology). Facilitated by Kevin Waugh.

# Robotics Group

## Wednesday 3:15 to 5:00pm(ish).

This is a new group this term. Participants are expected to have some basic python coding skills - just check with us if you are unsure. As with everything we do, it is mostly "learn as you go" but Python will be the main language so it is good to have a head start. We will probably be creating some crazy autonomous mobile AI robots. Facilitated by Kevin Waugh 

Important:
1. You need a laptop (or PC) or have talked to us about using one of our spares.

# Technohackers Coding Group

## Ages 9+, Thursday 3:15 to 5:00pm.

Before you can create your own AI overlord, make a billion dollars with your game, or construct your mind-controlled VR game, you need to play with code. This group is for doing just that with friends. Our older members help out and we also teach each other.

Facilitated by Kevin Waugh and the senior QRL members.

Important:
1. You need a laptop (or PC) or have talked to us about using one of our scarce spares. Chrome books and tablets are not ideal but might be ok at the beginning.

# Questionable Projects Group

## Teens, Thursday 5:30pm to 8:30pm.

This is teens only (13+) and it is our time for ANY project. Any. It could be coding, making, designing, whatever. Really. If you are into something, be into it with others. This is a social, clever, weird, play time. We have a shared unhealthy dinner, so bring $8 to join in on that. Now we have a kitchen we might have a go at cooking at some point. I am open to ideas.
