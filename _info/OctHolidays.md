 - __Wednesday 5th__ and again on __Wednesday 12th__  8:30 to 5pm<br> 
This is a __just for fun__ social day.<br>
Hangout in the Lab, play games, bring your computer/laptop.<br><br>

<p align="center"><b>Serious Days</b></p>
- __Friday 7th__ and again on __Friday 14th__  8:30 to 5pm<br> 
These two days are __Project Days__. They are for those who have things they want to do/or have things they are working on, and enjoy doing it in a social environment. It might be coding, or electronics or general making or designing or even school work. It doesn't really matter what you want to do. This is a time and space to *do your thing* in a social environment.
