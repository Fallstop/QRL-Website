Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly…

Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. __The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.__ *Dantooine.* They're on Dantooine.

## I care. So, what do you think of her, Han?

You mean it controls your actions? I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan-- I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.

1. I'm trying not to, kid.
2. Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.
3. Partially, but it also obeys your commands.

### The Force is strong with this one. I have you now.

Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. Partially, but it also obeys your commands.

* Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.
* Partially, but it also obeys your commands.
* The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.

Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide.

You don't believe in the Force, do you? You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!

Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight?

Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. As you wish. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.

Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you.

You don't believe in the Force, do you? No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly… Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. Partially, but it also obeys your commands.

What?! A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Partially, but it also obeys your commands. What?!

Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. Partially, but it also obeys your commands. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.

Don't underestimate the Force. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. What?! Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.

Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. Ye-ha! Don't underestimate the Force. I'm trying not to, kid.

You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! I'm trying not to, kid. The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. You don't believe in the Force, do you?
