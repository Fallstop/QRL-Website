## Technohackers Science and Technology Group

### Ages 9+, Tuesday 3:15 to 5:00pm.

The Science and Technology session is an after school group for kids and young teens looks into science and technology with a bit of an experimental angle. We intend it to be a fun clever environment where disaster has plenty of opportunity. The things we do and the topics we cover will be eclectic. Each term will focus on a theme but will stray a bit as we see other interesting things to play with. Term 1 this year we will be looking at Sci-Fi topics. Previously we investigated plastic, looked at the brain and perception (reality), tested ideas in building and construction, looked into Forensics, food Chemistry, Circus Acts, rockets and projectiles and more. We never follow a linear path so who knows what we might do this year?

## Questionable Projects Group

### Teens, Thursday 5:30pm to 8:30pm.

This group is for our older members (13+yrs) to have time and space for disrupting the universe, playing games and working on projects. Probably in a 10:40:50 ratio.

Play, Eat, Talk, Code, Make, Test, Panic, Pretend we know what we are doing, Relax.

• Let’s kick of the year with a focus on some existing projects (VR/Tens game, Vending machine, Unity coding, Repairing of various things, Water tank monitor system, all spring to mind). New projects will unavoidably arise (serious and the less than serious).
• As with last year, bring $5 (or a bit more) for a shared Pizza dinner.
• In a nutshell: This group is where questionable projects meet curious people. And stuff happens.

## Technohackers Coding & Robotics Group

### Ages 9+, Thursday 3:15 to 5:00pm.

The Technohackers Coding Group is all about getting into coding and dreaming about the cool game your going to make or the slightly insane robot you are going to build. You can start in this group without knowing what you are doing and work towards your own creations. This group is about learning coding and robotics.

Contact Kevin for more information. Participants will ideally have access to a laptop, perseverance and a love of computer games. We have a couple spare laptops and are always looking for not-too-old donations.
