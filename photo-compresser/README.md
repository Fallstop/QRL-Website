# Standardized Photo Compressor
To use, first place the images you want to use in the `source-images` folder, then make sure you have python installed before running `start.bat` (Windows) or `start.sh` (Linux).

The program will then prompt you to select your thumbnail and the rest of the photos you are using.

It will compress and format the photos and place them in the originating directory with the `*-o.*` format, and name the thumbnail `thumbnail-o.*`.
